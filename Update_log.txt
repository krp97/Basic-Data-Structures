1) 7 July, 2018

	- Cleanup of Dynamic Array class 
	- Added Node abstract class to correct the logic structure
	- Added file handling functions

2) 8 July, 2018

	- Redesigned logic structure and relations between classes
	- Refactoring:
		+ Changed names of files to better represent current logic structure
	- Changed the approach to memory allocation:
		+ The array is now characterized by an added attribute "maxSize".
		  This provides an actual size of a block of memory allocated.
		  The Array is no longer reallocated with each push and pop,
		  but preallocated with a bigger size.(See code comments in Array for more).
3) 9 July, 2018

	- Partial implementation of a List iterator(todo: pointer validation)
	- Redesigned the list methods to accomodate the iterator implementation
	+ todo: destructor for the List class, iterator security

4) 10 July, 2018

	- Finalized iterator implementation for the List
	- Fixed memory leaks in Array and List classes
	- Implemented Doubly Linked List and an iterator for it
	- Misc (comments)

5) 11 July, 2018

	- Following elements were introduced:
		* Heap
		* Stack (Both are still to be extensively tested)
		* Class wrapper for the timing functions
		* Partial implementation of a menu for user interaction
 
6) 12 July, 2018

	- Implemented Handlers for the menu. Each submenu has each own handler,
	  which contain a set of switch cases depending on the corresponding class components.
	- Reorganized files within the directory.

7) 13 July, 2018

	- Started to implement user input correction for the menus
	- Fixed bugs in the Array structure
	- Minor logic changes (Handler class access modifiers)
