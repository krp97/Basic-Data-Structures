1) 7 July, 2018
	- Cleanup of Dynamic Array class 
	- Added Node abstract class to correct the logic structure
	- Added file handling functions
2) 8 July, 2018
	- Redesigned logic structure and relations between classes
	- Refactoring:
		+ Changed names of files to better represent current logic structure
	- Changed the approach to memory allocation:
		+ The array is now characterized by an added attribute "maxSize".
		  This provides an actual size of a block of memory allocated.
		  The Array is no longer reallocated with each push and pop,
		  but preallocated with a bigger size.(See code comments in Array for more).
